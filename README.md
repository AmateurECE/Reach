# The Motivation Behind Reach

I currently use a popular open-source media server to stream my music over the
Internet. The issue, however, is that as I'm collecting more and more
high-quality tracks in lossless codecs such as FLAC, my media server is no
longer able to stream over my 5Mb/s residential upload connection.

The solution is not to sacrifice the quality of the audio, nor to shell out
more money to my ISP for an upgrade. The solution is _Reach_, a tool that
utilizes the existing network bandwidth more efficiently to deliver low-latency
music streaming over any connection.
